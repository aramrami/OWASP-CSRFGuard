## Overview

Welcome to the home of the OWASP CSRFGuard Project! OWASP CSRFGuard is a library that implements a variant of the synchronizer token pattern to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. The OWASP CSRFGuard library is integrated through the use of a JavaEE Filter and exposes various automated and manual ways to integrate per-session or pseudo-per-request tokens into HTML. When a user interacts with this HTML, CSRF prevention tokens (i.e. cryptographically random synchronizer tokens) are submitted with the corresponding HTTP request. It is the responsibility of OWASP CSRFGuard to ensure the token is present and is valid for the current HTTP request. Any attempt to submit a request to a protected resource without the correct corresponding token is viewed as a CSRF attack in progress and is discarded. Prior to discarding the request, CSRFGuard can be configured to take one or more actions such as logging aspects of the request and redirecting the user to a landing page. The latest release enhances this strategy to support the optional verification of HTTP requests submitted using Ajax as well as the optional verification of referrer headers.

2. Clone this repository locally
3. Build the project by running ```mvn clean install``` in the project root directory
4. Build and run the test JSP web application by running ```mvn pre-integration-test -Pdeploy-jsp-webapp -pl csrfguard-test/csrfguard-test-jsp``` or ```mvn -Pdeploy-jsp-webapp -pl csrfguard-test/csrfguard-test-jsp tomcat7:run```
5. Optional: you can use ```mvnDebug``` to enable remote debugging, then connect your IDE to it (default port is 8000)
6. Use a web browser to access ```http://localhost:8080``` to open the home page of the test project

## Uploading to the Maven Central repository

1. Follow the [Sonatype Open-Source Project Maven Repository Usage Guide](https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide) to create a Sonatype user account;

## Last News

An important security fix has been applied to the CSRFGuard version 3.0.


Do a token pre-fetch on every page.

Instead of hard coding the CSRF token, we send a POST request to fetch the token and populate the JS variable.

Thanks to Ahamed Nafeez <ahamednafeez@gmail.com> for this fix.

Thanks to Trent Schmidt and Joel Orlina (JIRA)  for there help.

## CSRFGuard integration with a JSF application

Yi SONG create for CSRFGuard project a simple example to demostrate the CSRFGuard integration with a JSF application.

The original JSF project is taken from https://mkyong.com/jsf2/jsf-2-0-hello-world-example/

After integrating with csrfguard, the project has been tested on netbean 8.2 with glassfish 4.1.1

### Yi SONG Bio:
Yi SONG received my master of engineering in China in 2006. Then I start work for Axalto, then Gemalto  and then Thales till now.
He has 3 years experience on smartcard development, 10 years experience on cryptography and hardware security module. Since end of 2018, his work is focusing on web application and cloud.
