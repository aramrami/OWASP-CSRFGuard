The OWASP CSRFGuard is one of the worldâ€™s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by a pool of international volunteers*. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications. It's also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing.

Welcome to the home of the OWASP CSRFGuard Project! OWASP CSRFGuard is a library that implements a variant of the synchronizer token pattern to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. 

The OWASP CSRFGuard library is integrated using JavaEE Filter and exposes various automated and manual ways to integrate per-session or pseudo-per-request tokens into HTML. When a user interacts with this HTML, CSRF prevention tokens (i.e. cryptographically random synchronizer tokens) are submitted with the corresponding HTTP request. 

It is the responsibility of OWASP CSRFGuard to ensure the token is present and is valid for the current HTTP request. 

Any attempt to submit a request to a protected resource without the correct corresponding token is viewed as a CSRF attack in progress and is discarded. Prior to discarding the request, CSRFGuard can be configured to take one or more actions such as logging aspects of the request and redirecting the user to a landing page. 
The latest release enhances this strategy to support the optional verification of HTTP requests submitted using Ajax as well as the optional verification of referrer headers.
